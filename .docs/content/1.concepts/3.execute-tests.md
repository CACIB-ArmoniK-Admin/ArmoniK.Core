# How to execute tests in ArmoniK Core?

## Unit tests independent of deployment

For this type of tests, you can directly execute it. The first option is to run the tests using your code editor. The second is to open a terminal, go to the folder where the test project is located and do:

```shell
dotnet test
```

## Unit tests that need partial deployment

First, you should do the needed partial deployment that deploys the container running needed service.
For example, for the case of ArmoniK.Core.Adapters.RabbitMQ.Tests, execute:

```shell
just queue=rabbitmq deployTargetQueue
```

For ArmoniK.Core.Adapters.LocalStorage.Tests deploy with local object storage:

```shell
just object=local deployTargetObject
```

And so you can execute the corresponding tests:

- via your code editor
- or in your command line, go to the folder where the test project is located and do:

```shell
dotnet test
```

## Integration tests

HtcMock, Stream and Bench are integration tests that need a Core deployment. To be able to run these tests, you need first to deploy ArmoniK Core with the appropriate values for the parameter `worker`: htcmock, stream or bench. If you don't specify any value for this parameter, it's set to htcmock by default. Don't forget to use the recipe to build the images for your deployments if they do not exist.

### Htcmock

The default deployment is done with htcmock worker:

```shell
just deploy
```

After this deployment, there is a `just` recipe that allows to build the docker image to test htcmock worker, you can use this recipe to build the image:

```shell
just buildHtcmockClient
```

Finally execute the test using:

```shell
docker run --net armonik_network --rm \
            -e HtcMock__NTasks=100 \
            -e HtcMock__TotalCalculationTime=00:00:00.100 \
            -e HtcMock__DataSize=1 \
            -e HtcMock__MemorySize=1 \
      	    -e HtcMock__EnableFastCompute=true \
            -e HtcMock__SubTasksLevels=1 \
            -e HtcMock__Partition=TestPartition0 \
            -e GrpcClient__Endpoint=http://armonik.control.submitter:1080 \
             dockerhubaneo/armonik_core_htcmock_test_client:TAG

```
You will need to replace `TAG` by the tag of your image `armonik_core_htcmock_test_client`. If you don't specify any tag for `just buildHtcmockClient`, the tag will be `test`, but you are given the option to use your own tag:

```shell
just tag=mytag buildHtcmockClient
```

### Stream

Deploy using stream worker:

```shell
just worker=stream deploy
```

Use the recipe to build the docker image for stream worker:

```shell
just buildStreamClient
```

Now, you can execute the tests using your code editor, or via the command line. In the latter case, go to the folder where the tests are located and type:

```shell
dotnet test
```

### Bench

Deploy using bench worker:

```shell
just worker=bench deploy
```

Build the docker image:

```shell
just buildBenchClient
```

Execute the tests using:

```shell
docker run --net armonik_network --rm \
            -e BenchOptions__NTasks=200 \
            -e BenchOptions__TaskDurationMs=100 \
            -e GrpcClient__Endpoint=http://armonik.control.submitter:1080 \
            dockerhubaneo/armonik_core_bench_test_client:TAG
```

Same for the case of Htcmock, consider replacing `TAG` by the tag of your image `armonik_core_bench_test_client` .
