# Tests in ArmoniK Core

Tests in ArmoniK Core are composed of unit and integration tests that verify the proper functioning of ArmoniK Core and the success of a deployment.

These are the unit tests that should run independently of ArmoniK Core deployment:

- ArmoniK.Core.Common.Tests
- ArmoniK.Core.Adapters.Memory.Tests
- ArmoniK.Core.Adapters.MongoDB.Tests
- ArmoniK.Core.Adapters.Redis.Tests (Only Windows)

These tests require a partial deployment in order to work properly:

- ArmoniK.Core.Adapters.Amqp.Tests
- ArmoniK.Core.Adapters.RabbitMQ.Tests
- ArmoniK.Core.Adapters.S3.Tests
- ArmoniK.Core.Adapters.LocalStorage.Tests

By partial deployment we mean that it is not necessary to deploy the full infrastructure, for example for the Amqp tests, a container running either activemqp or rabbimq broker is necessary.

These are the tests that need a Core deployment prior to running:

- Integration tests: Htcmock, Stream and Bench tests

You can execute the tests using a code editor, or via the command line.  It is recommanded to have an Integrated Development Environment such as Microsoft Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider.
To know how to execute tests, see: [How to execute tests in ArmoniK Core?](./3.execute-tests.md).
